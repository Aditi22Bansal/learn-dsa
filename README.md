# Learn Data Structures and Algorithms

This is a repository in which you can learn the data structures and algorithms practically, specifically in C++. The repository is divided into multiple folders like:
- Sparse Matrix
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List
- Stack
- Recursion
- Queue
- Binary Search Tree
- Heaps
- Searching Algorithms
- Sorting Algorithms
- Labs And Tasks

You can simply go to any folder, find a program related to that folder topic and learn from that, there are comments added in each program for better understanding.
