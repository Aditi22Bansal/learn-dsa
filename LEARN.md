# Learn Data Structures and Algorithms

Irrespective of the programming language you choose to learn, the basic concepts of programming and data structures & algorithms are similar across languages. 
Some of `DSA` concepts include:
- Arrays
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- etc

---

This is the repository where you can learn the `data structures and algorithms` practically with code examples, specifically in C++. 
Start learning by following the links below:

## C++

You can use [github.dev](github.dev) for coding. Or you can setup your IDE on your local machine. 
You can setup `DevC++` or `CodeBlocks` or `VScode` for running c++ programs.
